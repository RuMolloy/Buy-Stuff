# Buy-Stuff
Demo app to experiment with Google Play's billing system and app monetization.

The demo shows purchasing of consumable (can be purchased multiple times), non-consumable (can only be purchased once) in-app products and a subscription product. Admob is also integrated where a test ad appears on the bottom of the screen (see static screenshot below).

## Prerequisite
Requirement to have the app you're looking to add billing to released on the Play Store (internal release is fine..)

## Demo
#### Note 
Admob test ad seems to work intermittently at best with *Ad failed to load error code 0* returned in the console, seems to be a server side issue
